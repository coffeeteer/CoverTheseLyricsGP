          <li>
            If I choose to get the basket with the Grand Prize why do I only receive $450 instead of $500?
          </li>
            <ul>
              <li>When prizes in total (including money and object worth combined) totals over a certain amount, then the winner receiving those prizes must pay taxes. Because CoverTheseLyrics targets such a broad crowd (including people under 18), that is simply not something we want winners (of any age) to have to do.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>
            Is there a specific type of genre that I must choose?
          </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Absolutely not. The lyrics are given to you, but you can sing them however you like. Whatever genre or sub-genre or speed is yours. Get creative and have fun.

            Is it Cover These Lyrics or CoverTheseLyrics. Is it really just one word or can I separate them?
          </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The contest is called CoverTheseLyrics, and itâ€™s just one word.

            Do I have to use a camera to record my video?
          </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                No you do not. You can use a cell phone,  or whatever you are able to use. However I do suggest keeping in mind quality as I could see that playing a part in whether people watch and share your video.
              </li>
            </ul> 
          <li>
            Can I submit another cover, song, or lyric that is not featured on the website?
          </li>      
            <ul>
              <li>
