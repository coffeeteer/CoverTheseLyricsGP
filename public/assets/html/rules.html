<p><strong>How to Participate:&nbsp;</strong>Contestants of the CoverTheseLyrics (“CTL”) Contest must choose and perform in a lyric video, music video, or MP3 recording one (1) lyric only from the select six on pages titled “Lyrics Page 1” and “Lyrics Page 2”. Contestants have the option of performing the lyric with original music created by the Contestant (see <a href="#" target="_blank">CTL License</a> for details) or the contestant may perform the lyric&nbsp;<em>a cappella</em>.
